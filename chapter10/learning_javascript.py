"""
You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a string with a different word. Hereâ€™s a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:

>>> message = "I really like dogs."
>>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
'I really like cats.'

Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print each modified line to the screen.
