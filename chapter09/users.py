'''
Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user.

Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.
