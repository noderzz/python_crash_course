"""
Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5,000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.

Write a test file for Employee with two test functions, test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Write your tests once without using a fixture, and make sure they both pass. Then write a fixture so you donâ€™t have to create a new employee instance in each test function. Run the tests again, and make sure both tests still pass.
