#Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each person’s name and their favorite places.
favorite_places = {
    'joey':['spain','italy'],
    'katie':['mexico','canada','australia'],
    'june':['japan'],
}

for name,places in favorite_places.items():
    print(f"{name.title()}'s favorite places are:")
    for place in places:
        print(f"\t{place.title()}")
